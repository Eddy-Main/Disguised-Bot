# Disguised-Bot

This is my first personnal project : A Discord quiz bot simulating a mini-game from a game called Ragnarok-Online.
It took me a full month of work and... procrastination to finish it.
I used Node.js, which allowed myself to interact with discord.
It was also my first time coding on Javascript, which made quite a bit of change from my usual coding language.

I'll try to add html page with either screenshots or video to showcase my bot.

Thanks for dropping by !
